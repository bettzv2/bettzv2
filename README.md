## About Me!
Born and raised in Southern California, I am an undergraduate student at California State University, San Bernardino, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for technology, with a particular focus on data science and operating systems. In February 2024, I was honored to receive the ExCELS scholarship, funded by the National Science Foundation, which has been an invaluable recognition of my dedication to my studies and the field.

As a first-generation, low-income female student in STEM, I have faced challenges in finding my place in this field. However, in May 2024, I became a member of Break Through Tech, a virtual community for female and non-binary students launching their careers in technology. This program has played a pivotal role in helping me feel accepted and supported, fostering a sense of belonging in the tech community. Over the years, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and have had the privilege of collaborating with many talented peers on a range of projects.
